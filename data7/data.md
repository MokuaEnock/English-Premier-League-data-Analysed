# About Dataset

I have always wanted to find a way to propose performance scorings for football lineups in FIFA or for the real life. After lots of testings, I think I can propose a performance KPI the more realistic possible I added to this dataset. Thanks to a scrapping from SoFIFA website (thanks to them for their amazing job) you have now access with this set to all FIFA players' statistics and marks. Have fun !
