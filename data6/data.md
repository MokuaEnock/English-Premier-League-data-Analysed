FIFA 23 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts. It is the 30th and final installment in the FIFA series that is developed by EA Sports, and released worldwide on 30 September 2022 for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Google Stadia.

The role of performance analysis within football is more important than ever. Whether it’s the opposition, potential transfer targets or last weekend’s fixture, analysing performances and data can be the difference between success and failure.
