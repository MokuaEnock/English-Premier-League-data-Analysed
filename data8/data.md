# About Dataset

## Context
For most football fans, May - July represents a lull period due to the lack of club football. What makes up for it, is the intense transfer speculation that surrounds all major player transfers today. Their market valuations also lead to a few raised eyebrows, lately more than ever. I was curious to see how good a proxy popularity could be for ability, and the predictive power it would have in a model estimating a player's market value.
