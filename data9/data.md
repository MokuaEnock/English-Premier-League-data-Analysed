About this dataset
This dataset contains results and pre-match odds from matches of the English Premier League (EPL) from 2011 to 2021, providing a rich source of information to gain insights into betting patterns and match outcomes. The data has been collected from multiple sources, including popular betting sites such as Bet365, William Hill, Interwetten, Sportingbet and Ladbrokes. We investigate the EPL's recent history with columns such as home team shots on target, away team red cards or both teams hit woodwork among others. Moreover there is extensive in-depth analysis on bookmaker offering including home/away win/draw bets as well their respective over/under 2.5 goals offerings by Bet 365 or Betbrain for example. This dataset provides an interesting opportunity for those interested in football analytics and sports betting enthusiasts alike to explore how decisions around play make-or-break a game's resultâ€¦and why not turn it into a profitable endeavour!

How to use the dataset
This guide will provide a few tips for getting started with this insightful dataset. With these tips, you can use this dataset to help predict match outcomes and learn more about betting patterns in professional football.

Understand The Variables
The first step is to familiarize yourself with all of the column titles in order to understand what each column tells us about each different match. The columns give us information such as date, attendance, referee name, number of shots by each team, results at half time and full time.

Investigation
Once you are aware of which variables are available itâ€™s important that you start your investigation properly by exploring the data through aggregations or visuals tools like graphs or matrices so that those relevant insights jump out at you quickly instead of taking too long looking for them in too many different directions. Through visualisations we can get an overview quickly instead spending time and efforts doing it manually by looking for correlations between variables as well as understanding missing values if any exist (e.g., does one team have a tendency get more cards than another?).

Evaluate Your Options
Itâ€™s essential beginning any prediction process by talking over options â€“ which data should be used? Which actions ought to be taken? After we have evaluated our options based on available data points it is possible then focus models only after we know they will likely produce meaningful predictions beforehand due diligence is always important when working with new datasets such predicting probabilities given certain combinations parameters particulary when profanity involves such large underlying variables within sports markets being able capture predictive accuracy levels using models which comparative enough make sense only then consider deploying any sort automation even test tretment conditions first through conduction experiments designs isolate feature engineering performance Thus before making final model selection/deployment would need confirm degree exposure pricing coverage seek adequate feedback select appropriate approaches either through algorithmic techniques traditional approaches combine both together where necessary most importantly its important have solid confidence strategy once start building model automate decisions based around that strategy
Research Ideas
Analyzing betting patterns and trends in the EPL. Analysing the pre-match odds from various betting sites can provide insights into how certain teams, players or coaches are favored to win certain matches. This can then be used to predict outcomes of future matches or plan strategies for squads.

Investigating the effects of different environmental factors on match results by analyzing attendance rates and referee profiles at different matches across seasons and divisions. By examining this data, correlations between attendance rates and match outcomes can be studied among other correlations, providing potential insights into player morale, enthusiasm and performance levels of each side in particular games along with referees that may influence results during a game.

Studying team success metrics over time by looking at post-match statistics such as shots on target (HST/AST), hit woodwork (HHW/AHW) corners (HC/AC) and offsides (HO/AO). These metrics illustrate how teams perform in a specific match compared to their opponents thus giving an indication of team objectives set before kick-off as well as which goals were achieved during play time allowing better judgement upon management decisions leading into each fixture up until its conclusion
